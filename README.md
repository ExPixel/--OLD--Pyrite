# Pyrite

A GBA Emulator

- For quick tests of the emulator's functionality, use ```cargo build``` and ```cargo run -- [ROM]``` (< 60 FPS, maybe < 30 FPS)
- To run the emulator at full speed, ```cargo build --release``` and ```cargo run --release -- [ROM]``` (60 FPS+)

Some Screenshots:

**I'm too afraid to press start, so I'm not even sure how far through Fire Red the emulator can go right now.**

**NOTE**: The first 4 LDM tests are supposed to fail (they do on real hardware.)
