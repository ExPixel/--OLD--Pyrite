# Pyrite2
A GBA emulator(?)

A rewrite of Pyrite. Some of these commit messages are going to be really stupid and lack much description, as the emulator isn't yet at a point where commits really need to be tracked. For now I'm just trying to get something working and am using Github to keep the code somewhere more reliable than my laptop.
