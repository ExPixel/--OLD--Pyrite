# Pyrite2
A GBA emulator(?)

A rewrite of Pyrite. Some of these commit messages are going to be really stupid and lack much description, as the emulator isn't yet at a point where commits really need to be tracked. For now I'm just trying to get something working and am using Github to keep the code somewhere more reliable than my laptop.

Source Markup:

- \#TODO comments are used to mark small tasks that are still not finished. They sometimes correspond to the tasks in the TODO.todo file.

- \#FIXME comments are used to mark small sections of code that are possibly incorrect, but I couldn't find documentation on or didn't want to waste time so I put them off.
